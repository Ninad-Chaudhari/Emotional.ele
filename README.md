# Emotional.ele (Therapeutic Chatbot)

Access to mental health services and treatment remains an issue across the globe. The need for these services surpasses availability. Online therapy provided by a chatbot could not only improve access to cost-effective help but also be convenient for those reluctant to take therapy. Our aim is to leverage technology to enable more people to seek help. In the proposed method, we have built a responsive therapist bot that generates appropriate responses according to a person’s mood. The detection phase uses an ensemble of deep learning models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and text based sentiment analysis which classifies one's emotions into four categories – happy, sad, angry, and anxious
